## Security

In Video2Audio, we prioritize user privacy and data security. By utilizing ffmpeg.wasm for video processing in the browser, we ensure that users' files are not uploaded to any server, thus avoiding the risk of data leakage. All processing is done on the user's local device, ensuring the highest level of security and privacy protection.

## Getting Started

Using Video2Audio is very simple:

1. Visit the Video2Audio website.
2. Upload the video file you want to convert.
3. Wait for the browser to complete the conversion process.
4. Download the converted audio file.

It's that simple! You don't have to worry about file security because all operations are completed on your device, with no data being sent to external servers.
